# HauntWrite Steering Doc

## Coding Style
- Always use TypeScript.
- Use functional React components only.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Use Framer Motion for animations.
- Keep components modular and clean.

## Theme Rules
- Dark horror theme with neon purple/green accents.
- Use glitch effects on headings.
- Use animated floating shadows or smoke in background.
- No bright/light colors unless used for contrast.

## UI Guidelines
- Pages must use HauntedLayout.
- Buttons must be animated with glow effects.
- Output panel must have a reveal animation.
- Slider must visually match the spooky theme.

## Architecture Rules
- All pages under `app/` folder.
- Reusable components under `src/components/`.
- API routes in `app/api/*/route.ts`.

## AI Behavior
- Haunted output must preserve meaning of original text.
- Intensity slider must influence tone.
- Avoid low-quality repetitive horror clichés.

## File Structure
- No unused components.
- Descriptive file names only.
